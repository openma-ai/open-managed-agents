# Migration history after the OpenAI Agents merge

The merge joins two histories that started from the same schema:

- Released `main` added `model_cards.pi_config` in PostgreSQL
  `0022_chief_phantom_reporter.sql`, SQLite `0022_loud_the_captain.sql`, and
  Cloudflare `0019_shallow_spiral.sql`.
- The local branch added durable executions, environment service keys, and
  environment work generations with later timestamps.

All historical SQL filenames, contents, and journal timestamps are preserved.
Journal indices are consecutive; later snapshots follow the released snapshot
and include both sets of columns. Some preserved SQL filenames consequently
share a numeric prefix. Do not rename them to match the new journal indices.

Node runs `reconcilePiModelConfigMigration()` immediately before its normal
migrator. Empty databases and databases upgraded from released `main` use the
normal migration history. For the known local SQLite/PostgreSQL history, the
repair checks the exact applied migration hash and missing column, then adds
`pi_config` and records its original migration atomically. This covers databases
whose later Drizzle timestamp would otherwise skip the earlier migration.
Stored model cards survive, and repeated startup is safe. Unknown histories
are not rewritten, and migration errors fail startup.

MySQL was introduced on the local branch. Its previous snapshot
`d5cf91d0-02c4-4655-9ecf-af7e8d916ecc` upgrades automatically to
`f1e9f474-d719-4e31-b69e-dd7ae24f9bd4` by adding the missing column. An interrupted
upgrade can finish on the next startup. Snapshot
`f1e9f474-d719-4e31-b69e-dd7ae24f9bd4` then upgrades explicitly to
`2f8c3bdc-8be5-4f77-bc24-0d50f5ec66b3` by installing the usage-attribution
index. Both MySQL transitions are restart-safe. Other snapshot transitions
retain the existing explicit migration requirement. Cloudflare keeps its
original SQL filenames so D1 can apply the previously missing migration by
name.

Regression coverage lives in `test/migration-merge.test.ts` and
`test/main-node.mysql.integration.ts`. The former runs real SQLite migrations
for an empty database and both prior histories; the latter restarts a real Node
server against MySQL to verify upgrade and repeated startup. Check generated
snapshot chains with `drizzle-kit check` for the Node PostgreSQL, Node SQLite,
and Cloudflare auth configurations.
